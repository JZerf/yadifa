Known issue:
                _ on 32 bits architectures, the sig-validity-* fields are not properly copied from <main> to <zone>
                  as a workaround, set the sig-validity fields in each <zone> container in 32 bits architectures

                  ie:
                          sig-validity-interval 7
                          sig-validity-regeneration 168
                          sig-validity-jitter 3600
